Using Eclipse to debug tests run with Maven is easy. Say you want to debug the MySuperClassTest class:

    Start the Maven test just for this class in debug mode:
    mvn -Dtest=MySuperClassTest -Dmaven.surefire.debug test

    The test will wait for Eclipse to connect.
    Open the Debug Configuration of Eclipse and set up a remote application on port 5005. Run the configuration, the test will resume. You can use break points and all the usual features of Eclipse debugging.
